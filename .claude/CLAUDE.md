# Project Configuration

- Name: Society
- Path: /home/persist/repos/work/vazio/Society
- Description: Agent-based society simulation with economic and social systems
- Overview: A Python simulation framework implementing ECS architecture for modeling societal interactions, economic behaviors, and agent-based decision making

## Current Status
- Phase: Initialization
- Active Agents: @agent-coordinator
- Session: Starting

## Project Architecture
- Core: Entity Component System (ECS)
- Language: Python
- UI: Pygame-based visualization
- Features: Economic simulation, social dynamics, agricultural systems, workplace management

## Active Rules
- Follow ECS architecture patterns
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
- Use type hints throughout Python code
- Keep systems modular and testable
- Document complex algorithms and behaviors

## Dependencies
- Python 3.13+
- Pygame for visualization
- NumPy for calculations
- Custom ECS framework

## Current Sprint
- Phase: Project Analysis
- Lead: @agent-coordinator
- Status: Initializing
