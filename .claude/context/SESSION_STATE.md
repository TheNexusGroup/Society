## Checkpoints
- [x] Project Analysis (Completed by @agent-coordinator)
- [x] Deep Simulation Analysis (NEW - Completed by @agent-coordinator)
- [x] Research Phase (Skipped - architecture established)
- [x] Planning Phase (Skipped - design 90% complete)
- [x] Implementation Phase (85% complete - core systems done)
- [ ] Testing Phase (0% - CRITICAL GAP)

- [ ] Deployment Phase (0% - needs setup)

## Deep Analysis Results (NEW)
**Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed review of simulation logic, performance, and realism completed
**Critical Findings**: 
- **Memory Leaks**: Agent brain social memory grows unbounded
- **Missing Death System**: No starvation death (energy = 0)
- **Reward Imbalance**: Inconsistent reward normalization across actions
- **Performance Issues**: No spatial indexing, all systems update at 60 FPS
- **Missing Realism**: No resource chains, health system, or economic feedback loops

**Simulation Completeness**: 55/100 (Overall Realism Score)
- Core Systems: 85% complete
- Agent AI: 80% complete  
- Economics: 60% complete
- Social Dynamics: 70% complete
- Agriculture: 50% complete

## TOP 5 CRITICAL PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED
1. **Fix Memory Leaks & Performance** (CRITICAL) → @agent-backend_developer
2. **Implement Death & Health System** (HIGH) → @agent-backend_developer  
3. **Balance Reward System** (HIGH) → @agent-backend_developer + @agent-test_engineer
4. **Add Resource Chains** (MEDIUM) → @agent-backend_developer
5. **Create Comprehensive Tests** (HIGH) → @agent-test_engineer

## Assessment Summary
**Project**: Agent-based society simulation with ECS architecture
**Strengths**: 
- Hybrid AI system (Q-learning + neural networks)
- Social dynamics with trust/relationship tracking
- ECS architecture with 14 systems
- Economic system with workplace dynamics
- Pygame visualization working

**Critical Issues Found**:
1. Memory leaks in agent brain (unbounded social memory growth)
2. No death/mortality system (agents can't die from starvation)
3. Reward system imbalance (eating = removed_food/10, inconsistent)
4. Performance bottlenecks (no spatial indexing, 60 FPS system updates)
5. Missing economic feedback loops (fixed prices, no supply/demand)

**Missing Critical Features**:
1. Environmental systems (weather, seasons, disasters)
2. Health & mortality (disease, healthcare, aging effects)
3. Government & laws (taxation, enforcement, politics)  
4. Resource chains (raw materials → products)
5. Housing & infrastructure systems

## Recommended Workflow Path (UPDATED)
**Decision**: CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLUTION + TESTING (simulation needs stability fixes)

**Immediate Track 1 - Critical Fixes** (Week 1):
- Deploy @agent-backend_developer → Fix memory leaks, implement death system
- Focus: Agent cleanup, starvation death, basic performance optimization

**Immediate Track 2 - Testing Infrastructure** (Week 1): 
- Deploy @agent-test_engineer → Set up pytest, create stress tests
- Focus: Population stress tests, economic collapse scenarios, memory leak detection

**Phase 2 - Simulation Enhancement** (Week 2):
- Deploy @agent-backend_developer → Resource chains, economic dynamics
- Focus: Supply/demand pricing, resource depletion, health system

**Phase 3 - Performance & Infrastructure** (Week 3):
- Deploy @agent-devops_engineer → Requirements.txt, Docker, CI/CD
- Deploy @agent-performance_engineer → Spatial indexing, system throttling

## Active Work
- Deep simulation analysis completed by @agent-coordinator
- SIMULATION_ANALYSIS.md created with detailed findings
- Critical performance and logic issues identified
- Ready for immediate critical issue resolution

## Next Steps (UPDATED - HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Deploy @agent-backend_developer IMMEDIATELY for memory leak fixes
2. Deploy @agent-test_engineer to create stability tests  
3. Fix death system (energy = 0 should kill agents)
4. Implement proper agent cleanup when agents die
5. Add spatial indexing for performance
